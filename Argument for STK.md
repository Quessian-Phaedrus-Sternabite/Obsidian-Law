There are three points to address. The first is that the condom distribution and sex ed program violates previously established ideals of role models in school and keeping obscenity out of the classroom. Secondly, in prior cases, the Court has ruled against similar programs that fail to provide an opt-in or out protocol for parents, on account of the minors' lack of status. Finally, by forcing the issue in schools, the school district goes against the rights to rear their children granted to the parents by the 14th Amendment. 

Primarily, the position of schools has always been to promote good behavior and actions to children. This stance has previously been upheld by the Court, such as in [[Chambersburg A. S.D. v. Pa. Lab. Rel. Bd. (1981)]]. In that case, teachers were banned from smoking due to the act being a negative one that would harm students through exposure. The ban on smoking was done to ensure students were being exposed to proper values and role modelling. By providing condoms to students, promiscuity and fornication is seemingly endorsed by the schools. This case supports the idea that schools need to be places of positive values.

Furthermore, the idea of classifying materials that inform minors of sexual acts as obscene has likewise been held up in court. In [[Ginsberg v. New York (1968)]], it was ruled the the state had a compelling and "independent interest in protecting the welfare of children" when a man was convicted of selling pornographic material to a minor. Furthemore, this definition is upheld by //Elaborate on Bookcase, Inc. v. Broderick and Memoirs v. Massachusetts.

Next, it is valuable to consider the minors' lack of status 


For the third argument, the appellee would like the Court to consider [[Alfonso v. Fernandez (1993)]]. In this case, a program handing out condoms without prior consent was struck down for several reasons. Notably, a child's default position is that of incompetency. Furthermore, while a physician or authority figure could deliver medical services in an emergency, this does not extend to non-emergency conditions, such as the current state of STD's in the county. This is supported by [[Guerrieri v. Tyson (1942)]], in which a student was treated for an infection despite the issue not being life-threatening or immediately dangerous. The scenario present is not one that is life threatening, and there is no ground for the state to deprive parents of their right to rear their children.
