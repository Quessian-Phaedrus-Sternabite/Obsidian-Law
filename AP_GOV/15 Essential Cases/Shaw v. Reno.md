Shaw v. Reno

### Facts:
Post-Civil War, the 13th-15th Amendments established a set of protections related to voting. Despite the Jim Crow laws and anti-voting movements, voting equality was federally enforced with the Voting Rights Act in 1965 (See [[Baker v. Carr (1962)]] for possible justification). The need for redistricting every 10 years couples with a requirement against segregation in districts and the creation of majority-minority districts (districts with a majority of minorities, provided they exist in a large enough geographically clustered amount).

Despite making up 20% of the population of North Carolina, none of the state's 11 members of Congress were black. Following the creation of a 12th district, legislature moved to ensure a majority-minority district would be created (see diagram)

This resulted in a highly unorthodox district being drawn that concentrated votes to ensure the election of an African-American official. 

Following this, a suit was brought up that alleged this violated equal protection clauses as the district was based solely on racial boundaries. The District Court argued that race-based districting for the sake of benefitting minority voters does not violate the Constitution. The voters raised the issue to the SCOTUS. 
### Issue: 
Does discrimination based on race for the sake of benefitting minority voters violate the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause?

### Constitutional Text:
- 14th Amendment
	- “Nor shall any state…deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”
- 15th Amendment
	- “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”
- Gomillion v. Lightfoot (1960)
	- In Tuskegee, the boundaries of the city were redrawn to exclude almost all black voters. The SCOTUS reversed the lower courts claims of lacking jurisdiction, declaring such gerrymandering a violation of the right to vote on account of race.
- United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey (1977)
	- In New York, a Hasidic Jewish community was divided into districts during reapportionment. This was to achieve a minimum nonwhite representation of 65% in each district. SCOTUS upheld this plan, saying that increasing nonwhite majorities was permissible due to a lack of "fencing out" of the white population, and due to more equal representation being present in the end.
### Held: 
Argument for Shaw:
	The Constitution forbids the use of race as a deciding factor in districting. This constitutes as using race to draw districts.
	The shape of the district is neither compact nor contiguous, going against the criteria for district maps. The only possible purpose for district 12 was this representation.
	In Gomillon v. Lightfoot (1960), dividing voters into districts based on race is impermissible segregation. This applies regardless of who benefits.
	Assuming all people of color will vote the same is a stereotype, and ignores individual views and interests.
Argument for Reno:
	Using race for redistricting can be necessary to elect representatives who align with the people of the state.
	The Voting Rights Act of 1965 promotes segregated districts for the sake of opposing voting discrimination.
	Gomillon v. Lightfoot (1960) only argues against discrimination to oppose voters, not to benefit them.
Held:
	SCOTUS ruled in favor of Shaw, saying that redistricting to benefit minorities is undesirable as it discriminates in stereotypical manner. The breakup in districts according to race can lead to increased polarization. As such, the case was sent back to lower courts.
