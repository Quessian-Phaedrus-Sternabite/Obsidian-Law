Tinker V. Des Moines Independent Community School District

### Facts:
In 1966, as an act of protest, five students in Des Moines, Idaho, decided to wear black armbands to school to demonstrate against the Vietnam War. After learning this, the schools announced that wearing black armbands would be grounds for suspension from the school. Mary Beth Tinker, John Tinker, and Christopher Eckardt, were all suspended for violating the armband ban, causing a lawsuit. 

### Issue: 
Can a school prohibit students from wearing armbands in public as a form of protest, or does that violate freedom of speech protections guaranteed by the first amendment?

### Constitutional Text:
- Amendment I
	- Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech...
- Amendment XIV
	- No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States
- [[West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette (1943)]]
	- In this case, students were mandated to salute the American flag. Several students (Jehovah's Witnesses) sued against this on grounds of a religious objection. The salute mandate was ruled unconstitutional. In the case, government could not force people to express ideas they disagreed with. Freedom of speech was applied due to the fact that saluting the flag communicates ideas.

### Held: 
Argument for Tinker:
	Since students are included as "persons" as defined by the constitution, they benefit the same rights afforded to citizens. Furthermore, the 14th Amendment extends the protections of the 1st Amendment to cover states; as schools are state-government run facilities, they are bound by the constitution. **The students have a right to free speech.** In this case, the armbands are a form of speech that is simply silent and passive. 
	Additionally, the speech was not disruptive, and caused no disruption. Just because there are concerns for disruptions doesn't mean that schools can restrict freedom of speech. The same argument is true when considering that wearing the armbands does not infringe or intrude on the lives and work of any other students, teachers, or the school as a whole.
	Finally, since schools are meant to be an environment for the sharing of ideas, banning free discourse is directly antithetical to their purpose. Expression of ideas is a required part of the educational process. 
Arguments for Des Moines:
	Free speech is not an absolute right. Since schools are not an appropriate forum for protest, the 1st Amendment does not cover students debating. Supporting this is the fact that the armbands can be distracting to other students. The schools have a credible interest in banning the armbands in order to keep focus in classrooms, and acted within their correct judgement by doing so.
	Furthermore, the Vietnam War is extremely controversial--protest can polarize students and result in disruptions to learning, something the school has a right to protect against. Said protection includes ensuring students remain safe from bullying that may result from the voicing of controversial opinions. Due the this inflammatory nature of the armbands, the school banned them. Other expressions (such as shirts or voting buttons) are deemed acceptable so long as they aren't deliberately controversial.
	Finally, the Supreme Court risks overstepping its bounds by governing State/Local-run schools.

Decision:
The Court ruled in favor of the tinkers. They agreed that students retain their constitutional rights (including to free speech) within a school environment. Additionally, something that expresses your point of views is considered a form of "speech" for the purposes of the first amendment. Neither students nor teachers forfeit their rights when entering school buildings.
Additionally, speech can be limited if a "material and substantial" disruption can be reasonably predicted to occur. In this case, there was insufficient evidence for such a disruption.

Notable Dissent:
Justice Black was against the decision, claiming the 1st Amendment does not equate to absolute free speech at all times and in all locations. Additionally, since the armbands would cause a disturbance (he argued) by taking students' minds off classwork and onto a highly emotional subject, school officials would be negatively affected, and schools would be less functional.
