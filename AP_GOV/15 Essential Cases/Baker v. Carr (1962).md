### Facts:
Leading up to the 50s and 60s, many voting districts were unchanged, leading to discrepancies between cities and rural areas. Federal courts refused to get involved in such matters, leading to growing inequality. This case was concerned with whether or not federal courts had domain over state boundaries/districts.

In the 1950s, Tennessee had districts based off of the 1900 census, refusing to comply with regulations requiring redrawing of districts every 10 years. To argue this, Charles Baker claimed that the 14th Amendment was being violated, as he was deprived "equal protection" with "devalued" votes. The state courts argued that this constituted a "political" question not to be heard by the courts, leading to the elevation to SCOTUS.

### Issue: 
Are federal courts able to decide cases concerning state districting?

### Constitutional Text:
- Article III, section 2 of the U.S. Constitution
	- “The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority. . . .”
- 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
	- No State shall…deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”
- Colegrove v. Green (1946)
	- A similar case in which Illinois boundaries were contested. SCOTUS dismissed the case on grounds of lacking authority, as the court could not judge arguments that are political in nature in regards to the state.
### Held: 
Argument for Baker:
	This is admissible to the court, due to Article III, section 2 of the Constitution giving jurisdiction to issues "arising under this Constitution." As 14th Amendment rights were violated, this is an issue arising under this constitution.
	"Political questions" is an ill-defined term that lacks grounding. The claim that avoiding politics in questions leads to co-equal branches not conflicting is invalid, as this simply is instructing a separate branch to readjust.
	Tradition is not a valid reason to uphold an argument. There must be a reason for a court to not hear a case.
	Votes counting unequally is a serious violation of rights. The courts must be involved to ensure the protection of rights.
	Votes concerns can't be remedied by elected officials as they are the ones enforcing the corrupt districting.
Argument for Carr:
	Each branch is equal, and must not tell each other what to do/interfere with others' basic functions.
	Deciding this case is an abuse of power and invalidates state sovereignty. 
	Districting is a uniquely political function that is best left up to the states.
	The Constitution does not provide measures to address districting.
	SCOTUS has no place to interfere with the democratic process.
Decision:
	SCOTUS ruled in favor of Baker. According to the court, enforcing regulations on state officials to enforce the requirement of equal protection under the law means that this is a perfectly valid issue for the court. Even though politics may be involved, equal protection takes priority. Challenging inequality is not a "political question." 
	Instead of directly instructing TN to change the districts, they forced a hearing for Baker to determine whether or not the districts were imbalanced.
