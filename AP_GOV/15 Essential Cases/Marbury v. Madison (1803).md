Marbury v. Madison (1803)

### Facts:
Article III of the Constitution gives the Supreme Court authority over two cases: original cases and appeals. Original cases start in the Supreme Court whereas appellate jurisdiction cases are those that start in lower courts and are Appealed by the supreme court. In the **Judiciary Act of 1789**, the law authorized SCOTUS to issue "writs of *mandamus*--" a command to a lower court or public official to perform a special duty. 

For the case: John Adams appointed several judges at the end of his presidency in 1801. John Marshall--the secretary of state--was responsible for giving the paperwork to each new judge ("delivering the commisions"). Even though these commissions were signed and sealed, James Madison (the next secretary of state) was told by president Jefferson not to deliver these commissions, barring the judges from office.

William Marbury asked SCOTUS to issue a writ of *mandamus* to force Madison to deliver the commission. However, a minor conflict of interest existed, as John Marshall, the previous secretary of state, was now the Chief Justice. If SCOTUS issues this writ, Jefferson may refuse, weakening the Court. Chief Justice Marshall reframed the case as to one concerning whether or not SCOTUS could issue writs of *mandamus*.

### Issue: 
Can the Supreme Court order the delivery of a commission, and does Marbury have a right (both to the commission and to sue).

### Constitutional Text:
- **Article III, Section 2, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution**
	“In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.”
- Judiciary Act of 1789
	The Supreme Court can issue writs of *mandamus* to those in authority in the United States.
### Held: 
Arguments for Marbury
- The commission was valid due to the fact that the president ordered it.
- The Judiciary Act of 1789 is extremely clear in its worthy.
- Secretary of State Madison is required to obey President Adams' official act. Therefore, the Court should issue a writ of *mandamus*. 
- Article III can make exceptions to which cases have original jurisdiction in the courts. This case falls under original jurisdiction.
Arguments for Madison
- The appointment was invalid due to Marshall failing to deliver.
- The issue is political--not judicial.
- This is appellate, not original, and should be tried in lower courts first.
Decision:
The Court held that, while Marbury was entitled to his commission, SCOTUS lacked jurisdiction to require Madison to deliver. This boils down to the fact that the Judiciary Act of 1789 gives powers in a broader scope than exist in the Constitution. As a result, the Act was ***unconstitutional***. 

When ordinary law conflicts with the Constitution, it must be struck down. Furthermore, the justices of the Supreme Court especially are the ones who must interpret laws in regards to the Constitution. This defines **judicial review**, and grants SCOTUS the power to interpret law. Furthermore, this established the judicial branch as an equal partner to the other branches, as they can make decisions relating to law, and are the final authority on the Constitution.
