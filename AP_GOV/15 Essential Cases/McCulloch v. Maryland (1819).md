McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)

Facts: The national bank system was highly contested, with critics claiming that, as a national bank was not listed in the constitution, it was invalid. After Maryland instituted a tax on their state's National Bank, McCulloch (the branch manager) refused to pay it. Maryland sued McCulloch for this, saying that they could tax any business within the State. However, McCulloch followed up by citing the Necessary and Proper Clause.

Issue: Can Congress create a national bank under the Constitution. Additionally, can Maryland tax a national bank branch?

Constitutional Text:
- U.S. Constitution, Article I, section 8, Clause 18 (Necessary and Proper Clause). 
	- “The Congress shall have Power... To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.”
- U.S. Constitution, Article VI, Clause 2 (Supremacy Clause)
	- “This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding.”
- U.S. Constitution, Amendment X
	- U.S. Constitution, Amendment X

Held: 
McCulloch argued that the Necessary and Proper Clause allows for congress to make new laws (national bank). As there is nothing restricting Congress to only enumerated powers, and the creation of a bank is "Necessary and Proper" towards monetary matters, Congress is valid in creating a bank. Furthermore, states cannot interfere with Constitutional Measures due to the Supremacy Clause. Maryland rebutted by saying that not only does the Constitution fail to discuss a national bank, but it reserves power to the states that aren't delegated to the United States Federal Government. Since taxation especially is a predefined concurrent power, there is no reason why a state shouldn't be able to tax an invalid entity. Finally, the bank interferes with a state controlling their own supply of money.

The decision unanimously argued in favor of McCulloch, broadening the scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause. Additionally, since taxation of the National Bank would impede Congressional actions, Maryland was violating the Constitution and the Supremacy Clause.
