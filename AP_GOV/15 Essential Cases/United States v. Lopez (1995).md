McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)

Facts: 
Congress has the ability to regulate interstate commerce as described by Article 1, Section 8 of the constitution. In *United States v. Lopez (1995)*, Lopez argued that Congress overstepped their bounds. The Gun Free School Zones Act (GFSZA) prohibited guns within a school zone, and was contested by Alfonso Lopez Jr. After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed Lopez's conviction for violating the Act, which he claimed was invalid, the U.S. government elevated the case to the Supreme Court.

Issue: 
Did Congress have the power to pass the GFSZA?

Constitutional Text:
- U.S. Constitution, Article I, section 8, Clause 3 (Commerce Clause). 
	- “The Congress shall have Power... to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes…”
- U.S. Constitution, Article I, section 8, Clause 18 (Necessary and Proper Clause). 
	- “The Congress shall have Power... To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof."

Held: 
The U.S. argued that the GFSZA was valid under the Commerce Clause as the costs of gun violence can be interstate in nature. Furthermore, the pressure of gun violence both increases crime and negatively impacts students, both of which affect the national economy. As insurance costs are affected as well, and travel can be influenced by gun violence, the issue extends to a domain of commerce. As no state had legislature explicitly allowing guns on school property, Congress was not in conflict.
However, Lopez argued that, since the Commerce Clause only concerns commercial activities, and gun violence is not a commercial activity, Congress can't regulate it. Additionally, the classification of gun possession as commerce opens up the field to *anything* being classified as commerce, leading to mass government power. All in all, gun possession issues should be a state issue.
The Court ruled in favor of Lopez, 5-4. They marked that regulating gun possession near a school zone is not an economic activity, and that the Clause only covered explicit economical activities. Additionally, the potential breach of limitations was too much to ignore.
