McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010)

### Facts:
In 2008, a handgun ban was struck down in the Supreme Court as violating the 2nd Amendment ([[District of Columbia v. Heller]]). This opened up debate over whether or not this extended to the states and cities of America. In the case at bar, a gun ban was applied in Chicago (1982), leading to much dissent. After the United States began [[Vocab#^e88384|selective incorporation]], McDonald and other residents sued the city for violating their 14th Amendment rights, claiming that the Amendment extending the right to bear arms to local governments. All courts ruled in favor of Chicago, resulting in a SCOTUS appelation. 

### Issue: 
Does the 14th Amendment include the right to keep and bear arms and therefore limit cities' and states' ability to regulate guns?

### Constitutional Text:
- 2nd Amendment -“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”
- 14th Amendment - “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law….”
- [[Duncan v. Louisiana (1968)]] - A case that invoked selective incorporation in regards to the 6th Amendment. In the case, a man was sentenced without a trial for simple battery; he successfully appealed the case and had SCOTUS declare the right to a jury as applying to states.
- [[District of Columbia v. Heller]] - A case that ruled against a ban on handguns in the District of Columbia (Note that wider restrictions, such as against felon gun possession, are still allowed). This begged the question of whether or not the 2nd Amendment could be incorporated through the 14th.
	- Notably, these cases deal with "fundamental rights." These are rights that have been long held to be fundamental, such as right to jury or weapon ownership.

### Held: 
Argument for McDonald:
- The right to own weapons is a deep-seated right in American history, and falls under 2nd Amendment protections. 
- Furthermore, since most of the Bill of Rights provisions already are incorporated, the 2nd Amendment should be as well.
- Defense against a tyrannical government is one major reason for the 2nd Amendment; it makes no sense to allow for defense against a federal government and not a local one.
- The Chicago ban closely mirrors the one struck down in *Heller*; the Court should follow the earlier lead of allowing for home possession and revoking non-reasonable gun bans.
- Finally, since reasonable regulations (keeping guns out of schools, the hands of criminals, and limiting weapons to common use) aren't prohibited, a public safety crisis will not result from the application of the 2nd Amendment. 
Argument for Chicago:
- Traditionally, the Bill of Rights has been understood as a set of federal restrictions. Heller follows this, making sure that the *federal* government can't restrict guns.
- Since guns have changed so drastically, they are not a longstanding part of American tradition.
- Furthermore, as Chicago only *restricts* access to handguns rather than completely banning them, it proves to be a reasonable regulation.
- Additionally, gun control should be left up to the states, since safety issues can differ wildly. Applying the 2nd Amendment freely would lead to a large amount of country-wide guyn control strife as cities may begin to face serious problems.
- Finally, *Heller* maintains that the right to bear arms is not absolute, as handguns can be connected to a large amount of violence and death. 
Decision:
A majority of the Court affirmed McDonald, saying that the 2nd Amendment is extended against states via the 14th Amendment. Through historical records, the Court showed that the right to keep and bear arms was "fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty and system of justice." 
4/5 of the majority justices said that:
	Additionally, applying the Amendment only restricts unreasonable gun bans, such as the one in Chicago. Reasonable bans would be allowed.
However, this is not law, as it was not a majority.
Dissent:
Dissenting justices attacked the idea of the 2nd Amendment being "fundamental." This included an argument that the 2nd Amendment only concerned protections against federal encroachment, not state-level.
