##  461 U.S.  352

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/461/352/
### Summary
* An appellee was arrested and convicted under a statute which required persons who loiter or wander on the streets to identify themselves and account for their presence. Said appellee had 15 prior convictions over the course of the 2 years prior to the arrest, although he was only prosecuted twice and convicted once. The Californian court construed the statute to require a person to provide "credible and reliable" identification as "carrying reasonable assurance that the identification is authentic and providing means for later getting in touch with the person who has identified himself." The appellee challenged the statute's constitutionality in a Federal District court, their verdict is below.
**Conclusion/Verdict**
* The District Court held the statute unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. The verdict went as such:
* "The statute, as drafted and as construed by the state court, is unconstitutionally vague on its face within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to clarify what is contemplated by the requirement that a suspect provide a "credible and reliable" identification. As such, the statute vests virtually complete discretion in the hands of the police to determine whether the suspect has satisfied the statute and must be permitted to go on his way in the absence of probable cause to arrest."

### Use
**Carter**
* Vagueness doctrine. The fact that this case was held and deemed unconstitutional shows some merit in Carter's case- it links in with other due process cases, and perhaps shows a use in cruel and unusual punishment due to his prior convictions. Like I said at the beginning of this section, it also applies HEAVILY to vagueness doctrine. What is a "credible and reliable" identification is never specified in the law, leading to the verdict of the case landing in his favor. As for the total use for Carter, incorporate vagueness doctrine argument, and due process/14th amendment.          
**State** 
* N/A.
