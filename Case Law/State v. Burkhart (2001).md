## 58 S.W.3d 694 (Tenn. 2001)

https://casetext.com/case/state-v-burkhart-20

### Summary

Burkhart possessed slot machines without associated permits.
Upon discovery, they were confiscated and he was charged accordingly.
His defense was that the law prohibited "gambling machines," a definition that proved much too [[Important Quirbs#^802bce|vague]]. It was refuted.

### Use
* Carter
	* As other cases have shown ([[Connally v. General Construction (1926)]], [[International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky (1914)]]), vagueness refers to when it is hard or impossible for a person to determine what is meant by parameters. Gambling machines is a *clear*, rigid definition, that can easily be determined by anyone with the definition. Conversely, 1000 feet, while specific, is hard to be determined.
* State
	* The court ruled that even the vague term "gambling machine" is perfectly clear. 1000 feet is stricter, and very clearly delineates an area.
