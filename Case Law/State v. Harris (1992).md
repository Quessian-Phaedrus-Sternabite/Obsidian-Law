## 844 S.W.2d 601 (1992)

https://law.justia.com/cases/tennessee/supreme-court/1992/844-s-w-2d-601-2.html

### Summary

Billy Joe Harris sexually assaulted an 8-year old, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He then appealed, which failed. 
Test for [[Important Quirbs#^ce25e2|Cruel and Unusual Punishment]]:
* Does the punishment conform with standards of decency?
* Is the punishment grossly disproportionate?
* Does it go beyond what is neccessary?
(See [[State v. Black]]/[[State v. Ramseur]])
Of note is the fact that this crime "should" have been a Class B felony, first offense (8-12 years), making 20 years grossly disproportionate. Additionally, TN is notably strict on child molestation. However, with new acts, the punishment returns to 5-20 years.
### Use

* A sentence must be compared with the committed crime.
