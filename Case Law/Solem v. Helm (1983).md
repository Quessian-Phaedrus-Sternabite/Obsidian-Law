https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/463/277/

### Summary

A man issued a bad check for $100 and received life in prison with no chance of parole.
This was on an account of six prior felony convictions - 3rd degree burglary (3 times), obtaining money under false pretenses, grand larceny, and driving whilst intoxicated.
**Appealed** - reversed under [[Important Quirbs#^ce25e2|cruel and unusual punishment]]. 
Eight amendment protects against "sentences disproportionate to the crime."
Proportionality is constitutional
"There is no basis for the State's assertion that the principle of proportionality does not apply to felony prison sentences."
