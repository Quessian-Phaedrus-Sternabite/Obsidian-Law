## 405 U.S. 156

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/405/156/

### Summary


### Use
**Argument for Carter
- The Jacksonville Vagrancy ordinance under which the petitioners were convicted were declared void due to vagueness, and that it "Fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute". This can essentially be argued in Carter's favor; he was convicted in a school zone, but he, being of average (or perhaps below average) intelligence means that it's highly unlikely he knew the extent of the vagrancy law and the fact that he was in a school zone.
