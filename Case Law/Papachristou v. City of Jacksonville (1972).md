## 405 U.S. 156

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/405/156/

### Summary
There are 4 defendants and 8 petitioners in this case. There are Papachristou and Calloway-white females- and Melton and Johnson-Black Males. The four were charged for "prowling by auto" with the arrest being made because the defendants stopped by a used-car lot which had been broken into several times. The officers who made the arrest denied that the racial mixture had any role in the arrest. Despite this, however, there was no evidence of any breaking and entering at the time of the crime. There were also four other petitioners who appealed under the case- they go as follows.
* Jimmy Lee Smith and Milton Henry (not a petitioner) were arrested between 9 and 10 A.M. on a weekday in downtown Jacksonville. Smith was a part time worker, had a common law wife, three children, and was a part-time organizer for a negro political group. He was arrested several times, but only convicted once. He and his companion went into a dry cleaning shop briefly as Smith was cold and without a jacket; however, the owners suspected them and kicked them out, and as they paced up and down the street waiting for a friend, the owners summoned two police officers, and although neither had a weapon, they were arrested due to lacking an identification and because the police didn't believe their story.
* Heath and a codefendant were arrested for "loitering" and for "common thief." Heath had lived in Jacksonville his entire life, and worked as a mechanic. Heath had previously been arrested, but his codefendant had no arrest record. Heath and his companion were arrested when they drove up to a residence shared by Heath's girlfriend and some other girls. Some police officers were already there in the process of arresting another man. The officers asked them to get out of the car, which was consequently searched. Although no contraband or incriminating evidence was found, they were both arrested, Heath being charged with being a "common thief" because he was reputed to be a thief. The codefendant was charged with "loitering" because he was standing in the driveway, an act which the officers admitted was done only at their command. (To break lawyerly conduct momentarily, this is CRAZY illegal. Searching a car without a warrant and also forcing them out without precedent puts the cops 100% in the wrong. Kinda contributes to vagueness doctrine?)
* Campbell was arrested as he reached his home very early one morning and was charged with "common thief." He was stopped by officers because he was traveling at a high rate of speed, yet no speeding charge was placed against him.
* Brown was arrested when he was observed leaving a downtown Jacksonville hotel by a police officer. This was because "he was reputed to be a thief, narcotics pusher, and generally opprobrious character." The Officer called him over, to which Brown complied, and was promptly searched, which revealed to small packets which were later found to contain heroin. While he was compliant up to that point, brown began to resist when the pocket was touched.  He was charged with "disorderly loitering on street" and "disorderly conduct -- resisting arrest with violence." While he was also charged with a narcotics violation, that charge wasÂ _nolled_.
**Outcome**
	Due to the nature of the Vagrancy law, the case was overturned. They ruled that activities which, by modern standards would normally be innocent (i.e _Nightwalking_) are allowed by such a [[Important Quirbs#^802bce|vague]] law to be interpreted in a criminal manner. Such simple amenities of life like WALKING shouldn't be restricted by the law, and while there isn't technically a constitutional precedent, it's exceedingly dangerous to cast a wide enough net to catch any "loiterers".  It also puts the law more or less up to the discretion of the police officer who made the arrest. This gives the officer an unwarranted amount of power, and can result in exceedingly unjust arrests.
### Use 
**Argument for Carter
- The Jacksonville Vagrancy ordinance under which the petitioners were convicted were declared void due to vagueness, and that it "Fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute". This can essentially be argued in Carter's favor; he was convicted in a school zone, but he, being of average (or perhaps below average) intelligence means that it's highly unlikely he knew the fact that he was in a school zone, and the extent of the drug free school zone act. (The point of contention here is that he was within 1000 feet of a school, which elevated his felony a class).
**Argument for state**
* N/A-the law is exceptionally vague, and the arrests are questionable at best. The vagrancy law was declared void by the court, due to the exceedingly questionable circumstances and likely false arrests.
