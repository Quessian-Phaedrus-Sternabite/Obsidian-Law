## Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 24 April 1963

https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963.pdf

### Summary

- Consular relations requires consent. 
- Must protect the "interests of the sending State," promote friendly relations, and inform the sending State of the receiving State's activities. 
- Safeguard citizens of the state in the event of non-peace OR if said citizen is a minor.
- **Represent or arrange representation for nationals of the sending State, and preserve the rights of said nationals** (Article 5, Section i).
- **If nationals are arrested, the national has a right to notify their embassy** (Article 36, Paragraph 1, Section b).
- **In the event of arrest, consular officers may arrange representation for a national if they so desire" (Article 36, Section c).
	- These two are essentially Miranda rights. A national *must be informed* of their rights under the convention to receive representation and send notice to their home country.
### Use

The United States *did not* inform the two German citizens of their right of notification (Article 36, paragraph 1 (b)). Furthermore, this breach led to violations of (a) and (c) of the Article. 

### Plaintext

#### Article 5
(a) "protecting in the receiving State the interests of the sending State and of its nationals, both individuals and bodies corporate, within the limits permitted by international law;"
#### Article 36 
##### Communication and contact with nationals of the sending State 

1. With a view to facilitating the exercise of consular functions relating to nationals of the sending State: 
	(a) consular officers shall be free to communicate with nationals of the sending State and to have access to them. Nationals of the sending State shall have the same freedom with respect to communication with and access to consular officers of the sending State; 
	(b) if he so requests, the competent authorities of the receiving State shall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State if, within its consular district, a national of that State is arrested or committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any other manner. Any communication addressed to the consular post by the person arrested, in prison, custody or detention shall be forwarded by the said authorities without delay. The said authorities shall inform the person concerned without delay of his rights under this subparagraph; 
	(c) consular officers shall have the right to visit a national of the sending State who is in prison, custody or detention, to converse and correspond with him and to arrange for his legal representation. They shall also have the right to visit any national of the sending State who is in prison, custody or detention in their district in pursuance of a judgement. Nevertheless, consular officers shall refrain from taking action on behalf of a national who is in prison, custody or detention if he expressly opposes such action. 
2. The rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving State, subject to the proviso, however, that the said laws and regulations must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under this article are intended.
