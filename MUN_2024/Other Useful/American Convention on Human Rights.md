### Summary

Article 4, Paragraph 6
"Every person condemned to death shall have the right to apply for amnesty, pardon, or commutation of sentence, which may be granted in all cases. Capital punishment shall not be imposed while such a petition is pending decision by the competent authority."

Article 20, Paragraph 2 and 3
2. Every person has the right to the nationality of the state in whose territory he was born if he does not have the right to any other nationality.

3.    No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality or of the right to change it."

### Use

For Article 4, Germany can use this because the court denied the applications of habeas corpus despite valid reasoning. Second off, while a decision was pending, they again violated this.

For Article 20, Paragraphs 2 and 3, Germany can use this as a counter against the [[The Right to Information on Consular Assistance in the Framework of the Guarantees of the Due Process of Law]] Argument.

Rebuttal:
The U.S. is not a part of the American convention. As such, this is invalid. Furthermore, as laid out in [[Nottebohm (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala)]], when there is no genuine link, deprival of protections granted by nationality is reasonable. The law of a State does not have to bend.
