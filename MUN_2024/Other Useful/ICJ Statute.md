## # STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE

https://www.icj-cij.org/statute#CHAPTER_II

### Summary

This establishes what the ICJ has jurisdiction over (and literally everything else). For the case, we use Article 36. Specifically, paragraphs 1, 5, and 6. 

### Breakdown

##### **Article 36**

1. The jurisdiction of the Court comprises all cases which the parties refer to it and all matters specially provided for in the Charter of the United Nations or in treaties and co`nventions in force.

2. The states parties to the present Statute may at any time declare that they recognize as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement, in relation to any other state accepting the same obligation, the jurisdiction of the Court in all legal disputes concerning:
	1. the interpretation of a treaty;
	2. any question of international law;
	3. the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an international obligation;
	4. the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of an international obligation.

3. The declarations referred to above may be made unconditionally or on condition of reciprocity on the part of several or certain states, or for a certain time.

4. Such declarations shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall transmit copies thereof to the parties to the Statute and to the Registrar of the Court.

5. Declarations made under Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice and which are still in force shall be deemed, as between the parties to the present Statute, to be acceptances of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice for the period which they still have to run and in accordance with their terms.

6. In the event of a dispute as to whether the Court has jurisdiction, the matter shall be settled by the decision of the Court.
