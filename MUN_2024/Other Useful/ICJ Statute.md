## # STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE

https://www.icj-cij.org/statute#CHAPTER_II

This establishes what the ICJ has jurisdiction over (and literally everything else). For the case, we use Article 36. Specifically, paragraphs 1, 5, and 6. 

### Breakdown

##### **Article 36**

1. The jurisdiction of the Court comprises all cases which the parties refer to it and all matters specially provided for in the Charter of the United Nations or in treaties and conventions in force.
	1. If parties refer to treaties or conventions, the jurisdiction goes to the ICJ. This applies if there is a **dispute**.
