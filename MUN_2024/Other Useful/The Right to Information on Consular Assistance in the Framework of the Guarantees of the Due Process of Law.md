### Summary


Transcript of events happening in 1998

Treating those of different nationalities as having different levels of rights promotes inequality.

"_Concerning the expression “without delay” contained in Article 36(1)(b) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations:_

There is no basis for the suggestion that the expression “without delay” means that notification must occur precisely at the time of the arrest; rather, a defendant should be informed about consular notification following his detention or arrest, “within a limited, reasonable period of time that allows authorities to determine whether the defendant is a foreign national and to complete the necessary formalities”, and

When States have wished to agree to specify a precise time by which the consular notification procedure must be completed, they have done so by concluding agreements separate from the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations;"

"There is nothing to suggest that failure to give consular notification invalidates the convictions of a state criminal justice system; any such interpretation would be completely at odds with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the practice of States;"
