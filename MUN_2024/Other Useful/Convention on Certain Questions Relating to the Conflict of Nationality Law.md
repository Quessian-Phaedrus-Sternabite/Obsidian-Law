### Summary

"
### Article 1.

It is for each State to determine under its own law who are its nationals. This law shall be recognised by other States in so far as it is consistent with international conventions, international custom, and the principles of law generally recognised with regard to nationality."

Very useful. Rejects the [[Nottebohm (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala)]] genuine link argument. Overruled, however, by Nottebohm.
