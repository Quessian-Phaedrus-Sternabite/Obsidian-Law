Article 1, section 1
	"For the purpose of this Declaration, torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession, punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating him or other persons"
The rest simply concerns punishment. Argue for or against death, in being not painless physically or mentally, fulfilling these definitions.
