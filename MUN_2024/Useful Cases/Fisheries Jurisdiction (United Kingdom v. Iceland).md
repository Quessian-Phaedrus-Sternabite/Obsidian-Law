## Fisheries Jurisdiction (United Kingdom v. Iceland)

https://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/international-law/international-law-keyed-to-damrosche/chapter-3/fisheries-jurisdiction-united-kingdom-v-iceland/

### Summary

Iceland requested a change in treaty due to extreme changes since the treaty. This was not upheld, as there weren't extreme changes.

### Use

Not very applicable. An argument *could* be made that technology has changed to the extent that the original treaty is... more valid. This really doesn't apply.
