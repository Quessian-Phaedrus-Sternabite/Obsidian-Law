Use the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]

To spitball:
	Main issues in this case come down to the fact that the nationals were not told of their rights, and furthermore, were denied protection due to not mentioning them earlier. 

Outline:
Begin by establishing *why* this is applicable to the ICJ. Mention the points addressed in [[Rodley-HumanRightsHumanitarian-1989.pdf]], as well as the earlier precedent of [[Paraguay v. United States of America]]. **Most importantly** mention the [[Optional Protocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes]]. Article I contains the justification for the ICJ hearing the case.

Barcelona Traction, Light, and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain, 1970): The ICJ ruled on the issue of diplomatic protection, emphasizing the importance of the nationality of claims and the exhaustion of local remedies2


Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (1965): This treaty facilitated the protection of foreign investment and relaxed the rules governing the nationality of claims and the exhaustion of local remedies1
