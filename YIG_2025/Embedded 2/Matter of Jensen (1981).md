## 633 P.2d 1302 (1981)



https://law.justia.com/cases/oregon/court-of-appeals/1981/633-p-2d-1302.html

### Summary

Upholds the validity that the Court has jurisdiction in matters where involving a minor and actions that are a danger to them or others. Again, a medical case, but the broad definition it supports is useful. 

### Use

For Woodson, this supports this general idea that the Court can interfere in order to save the lives of children. HIV/AIDS is killing people[^1], and therefore the Court has jurisdiction.
