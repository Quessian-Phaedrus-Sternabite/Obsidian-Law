### Summary

Planned parenthood is trying to provide family planning equipment and information to a minor. 

Previously ruled that giving material to a child increases their propensity to fornicate underage, and therefore, this furthers lawless activities. 

### Use

Very useful for STK. There is no constitutional protection for minors to receive this information. Furthermore, parental right to raise their children is ensured by the 14th Amendment.
