##  431 U.S. 678 (1977)

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/431/678/

### Summary

"A state cannot constitutionally place any restrictions on the advertisement, sale, and distribution of contraceptives to individuals of any age."

### Use

Providing, advertising, and offering contraceptives to minors is constitutionally protected under the First Amendment. Furthermore, the constitutional right to privacy ([[Roe v. Wade (1973)]]) aids in support. 

"The right to privacy in connection with decisions affecting procreation extends to minors as well as to adults, and since a State may not impose a blanket prohibition, or even a blanket requirement of parental consent, on the choice of a minor to terminate her pregnancy, _Planned Parenthood of Missouri v. Danforth,_ [428 U. S. 52](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/428/52/), the constitutionality of a blanket prohibition of the distribution of contraceptives to minors is _a fortiori_ foreclosed."

Really useful. REALLY useful
