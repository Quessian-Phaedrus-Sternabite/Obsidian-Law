### Summary

A defendant cannot get summary judgment through a conclusory assertion that the plaintiff does not have evidence to support the complaint. Instead, the defendant must show the absence of evidence in the discovery record. Also, supporting affidavits are not required if the party moving for summary judgment does not have the burden of proof at trial.
