### Summary

Workers picketed in front of a business contrary to a law prohibiting any such actions that could impede business. 

### Use

~~Not applicable. Corp, not people. This is a financial issue--case at bar is a moral one.~~
May be some relevancy. 
"The legislative power of a state can only be exerted in subordination to the fundamental principles of right and justice which the guaranty of due process in the Fourteenth Amendment is intended to preserve, and a purely arbitrary or capricious exercise of that power, whereby a wrongful and highly injurious invasion of property rights is practically sanctioned and the owner stripped of all real remedy, is wholly at variance with those principles. P. [257 U. S. 329](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/257/312/#329). _New York Central R. Co. v. White,_ [243 U. S. 188](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/243/188/), distinguished."

*Very* loosely supports STK.
