### Summary

A ban on smoking in schools was implemented, despite bargaining from a teacher's union. 

### Use

An argument is present for each.
STK: The ban on smoking was done to ensure students were being exposed to proper values and role modelling. By providing condoms to students, promiscuity and fornication is seemingly endorsed by the schools. This case supports the idea that schools need to be places of positive values.

Woodson: The ban on smoking was done as a fact of health education. Teachers were providing an example of how to act positively by not smoking. Compare that to the program at bar, which provides healthy education to students and allows them to see how they should act with sexual intercourse.
