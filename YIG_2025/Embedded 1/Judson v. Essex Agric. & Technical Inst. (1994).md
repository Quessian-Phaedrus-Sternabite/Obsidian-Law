### Summary

The so-called "public duty rule" had no application in the circumstances of an action brought by a student against a county vocational school seeking damages for the school's alleged negligence in failing to inspect the plaintiff's workplace and in failing to assure that the employer provided workers' compensation coverage for the plaintiff while she fulfilled a curriculum requirement of participation in course-related employment. [162-163]

A county vocational school had no duty to inspect a student's place of employment and to ensure the employer provided workers' compensation coverage to the student while she completed a curriculum requirement of course-related employment where no existing social values or customs demonstrated that such schools have recognized such an obligation creating an expectation in students and parents that the school in question would exercise reasonable care to protect the student from uninsured employers. [163-164]

A "placement agreement" signed by a student, her father, the student's employer and her vocational school instructor stating that the student must be covered by workers' compensation insurance while she fulfilled a curriculum requirement of participation in course-related employment did not impose a duty on the school to ensure that the student was in fact covered.
Affirmed- The Vocational school has no reason to aid in the appellant under such circumstances
