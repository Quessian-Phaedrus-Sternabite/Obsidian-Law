## 497 U.S. 502 (1990)


https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/497/502/

### Summary

There are a few criteria that a facility must confirm before anonymously providing a minor with an abortion. 

### Use

More reading will be needed, but this can be beneficial for Woodson. There is nothing constitutionally restricting minors from receiving birth control standards anonymously--it does not violate parental rights. However, the child must be competent. 

### Embedded

[[Planned Parenthood v. Danforth (1976)]]
[[Bellotti v. Baird (1976)]]
