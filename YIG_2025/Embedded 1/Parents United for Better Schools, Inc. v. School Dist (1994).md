## Case Number

https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/commonwealth-court/1994/166-pa-commw-462-1.html

### Summary

Almost directly parallels case at bar. A school created an opt-out program for condom distribution. The Court ruled that this was unconstitutional, as the decision goes out to the parents. Very, VERY useful.

### Use

Directly supports STK. It is the right of the parents to decide how to raise their children. Furthermore, a lack of opting-out is NOT directly equivalent to consent.

### Embedded

[[Baker v. Carr (1962) (YIG)]]
[[Chambersburg Area School District v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (1981)]]
