## Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972)

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/405/645/

### Summary

A father had his children taken and declared dependents of the state after his wife died. This was due to a statute saying that, in the event of children having their mother die and their father unwed, they would be taken without consideration for the fitness of the father. This was attacked in court, with the petitioner eventually winning custody of his children.

### Use

Used to support the idea of state intervention only when the parents are deemed unfit or are harming their children.

Could be countered (supporting Woodson) by claiming that, by virtue of spreading aids and HIV, refusal of this program is harming the children
