### Summary

In Commonwealth v. Beiler, 168 Pa. Super. 462, 79 A.2d 134, the public school code of March 10, 1949, required every parent of any child of compulsory school age to send such child to a day school in which the subjects prescribed by the State Council of Education were taught. It was held that such requirements did not violate the provisions of the state and federal Constitutions guaranteeing freedom of religion, as applied to members of the Old Order Amish Church. Defendants were convicted for violating the compulsory attendance provisions of the public school code.
### Use

Wouldn't use, freedom of religion argument is dogwater, and that's the only thing this is even tangential to.
