### Summary

Title X. An act was made that forbade provision of contraceptives to minors without parental consent. 

"Â The Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program of the Social Security Act requires state plans to
> provide (A) for the development of a program, ..., for preventing or reducing the incidence of birth out of wedlock and otherwise strengthening family life, and for implementing such program by assuring that in all appropriate cases (including minors who can be considered to be sexually active) family planning services are offered to them and are provided promptly ... to all individuals voluntarily requesting such services...."
