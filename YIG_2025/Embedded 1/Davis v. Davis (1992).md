## 842 S.W.2d 588 (1992)

https://law.justia.com/cases/tennessee/supreme-court/1992/842-s-w-2d-588-2.html

### Summary

A married couple froze fertilized embryos for IVF. However, after this, they divorced. The mother, Mary Sue, wished to use the embryos to attempt to get pregnant, but the father was vehemently against such a process. Originally, it was decided that the embryos were legally "children in vitro," and the state had a right to insist pregnancy since it would be in the interest of the children. 

Fetus are not defined as people under law. Furthermore, Preembryos especially are not "persons." 

### Use

Very VERY loosely supports STK. State has a right to intervene in cases where children are at risk. Even if they decided against calling preembryos children, this still holds up, and there may be useful embedded case law.

### Embedded

[[Roe v. Wade (1973)]]
