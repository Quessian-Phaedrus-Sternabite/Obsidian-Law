_Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka_ (1954)

### Facts:
Equal protection under the law is given to all U.S. citizens through the 14th Amendment, with provisions made to enforce this equal protection. Even though laws, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1875 were passed to try and promote this equality, Supreme Court rulings limited equality heavily. Most notably, *Plessy v. Ferguson (1896*) ruled that "separate but equal" was allowed under the 14th Amendment--schools could be segregated so long as they were of equal quality. Unfortunately, this provided the foundation for Jim Crow laws. Furthermore, the Supreme Court ruled in *Plessy* that segregation was a social rather than legal issue, and the Courts couldn't mandate regulations. To quote: "If one race be inferior to the other socially, the constitution of the United States cannot put them on the same plane." This set the stage for more than 50 years of racial segregation and inequality.

For the case itself, Linda Brown (the petitioner) and her sister had to walk through an unsafe area to reach the bus to their segregated school. A closer, all-white school, refused entry on basis of race, which was permitted at the time under Kansas law. The Browns took Topeka to court, as they believed the segregation deprived the children of equal protection under the law. After the district court ruled that the segregation was detrimental, but not a violation of constitutional rights (using *Plessy* for support), the Browns took the case to the Supreme Court.
### Issue: 
Does "separate but equal" violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment?

### Constitutional Text:
- 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
	- “No State shall…deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”
- *Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)* 
	-  Louisiana law required separate but equal facilities depending on race; after Plessy was arrested for riding in a white-only train car, the court ruled that this was valid under the 14th Amendment. This was held into the Supreme Court, which held that segregation was allowed so long as facilities were equal.

### Held: 
Brown argued that the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause promotes equality regardless of race, meaning that segregated facilities, even if they're equal in name, violate the Clause. Furthermore, differences in funding meant that segregated schools deprived children of the benefits allotted to white students in white-only schools. This problem wouldn't be fixed by court-orders to "equalize" schools, as the segregation would always result in perceived differences. Segregation leads to racial biases taking root, and undermines black students. Additionally, the solution had already been tried, as some Topeka, Kansas high schools had already been desegregated without issue. Consistency would not only work, but should be the goal for schools. Finally, segregation, by virtue of perpetuating these ideas of inferiority to children, is morally wrong.

The Board rebutted by saying that people being treated equally did not necessarily mean they should be treated the same. They argued that giving people what they need should constitute equality, and as white people need to be comfortable, de-segregated schools would deprive students of their equal protection under the law. Furthermore, the Board assumed that black students would be more comfortable with other black students. Additionally, in Topeka, the schools do have equal facilities, meaning there should be no issue with the set up. Furthermore, education is a [[Vocab#^dace56|reserved power]], one allotted to the states, and it should remain that way since the states know best how to educate their citizens. Finally, because housing and schooling are codependent, desegregating schools would have negative effects on neighborhoods, as student might have to travel to attend integrated schools (ignoring, of course, that this is the issue at bar with Brown having to travel to attend a segregated school further than an all-white school). 

The Court unanimously ruled in favor of Brown, overturning the *Plessy* decision. Earl Warren delivered the opinion that the Equal Protection Clause was, in fact, violated by segregated schools. As schooling is necessary to public life, the government has a [[Vocab#^91b38e|compelling interest]], meaning they can pass legislature. The Court maintained that separate facilities, while perhaps equal in tangible nature, often resulted in feelings of inferiority and harm to the minds of African-American children, depriving the students of benefits present in white-only schools. As a result, schools, and many other facilities, could no longer be segregated under Federal Law.

The next year, a follow-up was released, *Brown v. Board of Education II*, in which Chief Justice Warren again delivered the opinion that desegregation should proceed as quickly as possible. To aid this, federal trial courts were created to oversee the process and ensure that desegregation proceeded in "good faith" with "all deliberate speed." Unfortunately, this specific language led to delays on behalf of the states, and caused more strife as the Court continued pushing for desegregation, eventually succeeding.
