## 467 Pa. 613 (1976)

https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/1976/467-pa-613-0.html

### Summary

Endangering the welfare of children is a valid reason to act. 

"The common sense of the community, as well as the sense of decency, propriety and the morality which most people entertain is sufficient to apply the statute to each particular case, and to individuate what particular conduct is rendered criminal by it."
### Use

This is useful for Both!
For Woodson:
The State, and by extension, schools have a duty to protect the general welfare of children. The condom program exists to protect the welfare of children, and as such, is constitutionally valid.

For STK:
Any act taken towards juveniles must be done to preserve the common sense of community and decency. The condom program exposes minors to sexually explicit ideas and therefore violates the sense of communal decency.
