## 98 U.S. 145 (1878)

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/98/145/

### Summary

"A party's religious belief cannot be accepted as a justification for his committing an overt act, made criminal by the law of the land"

"The court told the jury to

'Consider what are to be the consequences to the innocent victims of this delusion [the doctrine of polygamy]. As this contest goes on, they multiply, and there are pure-minded women and there are innocent children -- innocent in a sense even beyond the degree of the innocence of childhood itself. These are to be the sufferers; and as jurors fail to do their duty, and as these cases come up in the Territory of Utah, just so do these victims multiply and spread themselves over the land.'

_Held,_Â that the charge was not improper."
### Use

Really, *really* minor connection to Woodson. Essentially, bigamy is shot down on account of **harming the children**. The state can overrule religious objections if doing so would help protect children. In the case at bar, while there is no religious objection, the reasoning for state interference remains the same--children are being harmed.
