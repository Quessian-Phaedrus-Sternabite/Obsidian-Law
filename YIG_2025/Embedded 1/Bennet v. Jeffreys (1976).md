## Matter of Bennett v. Jeffreys, 40 N.Y.2d 543, 387 N.Y.S.2d 821, 356 N.E.2d 277 (N.Y. 1976)

https://casetext.com/case/matter-of-bennett-v-jeffreys-1

### Summary

The State "may not deprive a parent of the custody of a child absent surrender, abandonment, persisting neglect, unfitness or other like extraordinary circumstances" (40 NY2d at 544).

A mother did not surrender, abandon, nor was unfit to raise her child, yet was being denied custody. 
### Use

Same as [[Stanley v. Illinois (1972)]], in how this can be argued that either:
a) the State can only interfere when the child is actively being harmed or similar
b) the children are being harmed due to the high prevalence of AIDS/HIV in the area.
