## 505 U.S. 833 (1992)

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/833/

### Summary

A person retains the right to have an abortion, established by [[Roe v. Wade (1973)]], but the stateâ€™s compelling interest in protecting the life of an unborn child means that it can ban an abortion of a viable fetus under any circumstances except when the health of the mother is at risk. Also, laws restricting abortion should be evaluated under an undue burden standard rather than a strict scrutiny analysis.
