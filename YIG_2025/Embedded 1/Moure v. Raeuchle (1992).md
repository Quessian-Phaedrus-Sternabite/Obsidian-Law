### Summary

A woman underwent surgery to check her viability for pregnancy. During the surgery, it was discovered that her fallopian tubes were infected, and the tip was removed to allow for draining. As a side effect, the woman became fertile for 3-6 months. She did not approve of this, as she wasn't married, and sued for negligence. However, the lower court ruled that, as she was informed of the consequences, and the doctor acted in good faith to save her life, there was no incompetence. Really interesting case on informed consent, but not relevant.
