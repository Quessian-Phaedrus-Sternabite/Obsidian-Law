## 273 U.S. 284 (1927)

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/273/284/

### Summary

The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment affords the same protection to fundamental rights of private school owners, parents, and children against invasion by the Federal government and its agencies (such as a territorial legislature) as it has been held the Fourteenth Amendment afford against action by a state. P. 273 U. S. 299.

### Use

Supports STK. Parents have a right to decide what their children do and don't learn, and through the 14th amendment, this protection is extended against the state. Even though this case was focused on restricting the teaching of foreign languages in school, it applies to the case at bar as it represents the State taking an action against what the parents want for their children.
