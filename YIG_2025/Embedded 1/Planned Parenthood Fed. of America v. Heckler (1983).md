## 712 F.2d 650 (D.C. Cir. 1983)

https://casetext.com/case/planned-parenthood-fed-of-america-v-heckler

### Summary

Finding regulations issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services requiring all providers of family planning services which receive funds under Title X of the Public Health Service Act to notify parents or guardians within ten working days of providing prescription contraceptives to unemancipated minors inconsistent with Congressional intent and Title X, found no support in Title X, and were thus invalid

### Use

Very useful for Woodson, as it supports the idea that Title X protects the privacy of minors.
