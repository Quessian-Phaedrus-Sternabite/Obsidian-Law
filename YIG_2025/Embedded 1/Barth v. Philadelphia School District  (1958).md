### Summary

"A worthy objective does not justify the action of a school district or a public body, which has no fundamental or inherent powers of government, unless that action is authorized by the Constitution or by an act of the legislature."

A school began a program without approval and unsupported by legislature to curb delinquism. However, as there was nothing in the statute calling for this, it was basely ruled invalid.
### Use

Very useful for STK. Despite the worthy objective, "helping students," Woodson County has no grounds to implement a program completely unrelated to education. See also that a condom program is **not** education.
