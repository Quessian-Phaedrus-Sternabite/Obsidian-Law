## 390 U.S. 629 (1968)

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/390/629/

### Summary

A man was arrested after selling pornographic magazines to a minor. 
Constitutional interpretation has consistently recognized that the parents' claim to authority in the rearing of their children is basic in our society, and the legislature could properly conclude that those primarily responsible for children's wellbeing are entitled to the support of laws designed to aid discharge of that responsibility.
 
"(c) The State has an independent interest in protecting the welfare of children and safeguarding them from abuses. Pp. [390 U. S. 640](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/390/629/#640)-641."

### Use

Can be used provided there is something showing that the condom program is obscene.

The right for parents to decide what their children engage with is constitutionally enshrined. The state has a right to uphold protections only up to the point wished by the parents. 

### Embedded

[[Prince v. Massachusetts (1944)]]
) The New York Court of Appeals, in _Bookcase, Inc. v. Broderick,_ 18 N.Y.2d 71, 76, 218 N.E.2d 668, 671, construed the definition of obscenity "harmful to minors" in subsection (f) "as virtually identical to" this Court's most recent statement of the elements of obscenity in _Memoirs v. Massachusetts,_ [383 U. S. 413](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/383/413/), [383 U. S. 418](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/383/413/#418), and accordingly the definition gives adequate notice of what is prohibited, and does not offend due process requirements. P. [390 U. S. 643](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/390/629/#643).
