## 657 S.W.2d 425 (1983)

https://law.justia.com/cases/tennessee/court-of-appeals/1983/657-s-w-2d-425-1.html

### Summary

"Where the State undertakes to deny the rights of parents and their children, due process requires that the State support its charges by clear and convincing evidence. Santosky v. Kramer,Â [455 U.S. 745](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/455/745/), 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982)"

A young girl had Ewing's Sarcoma discovered in her, and was recommended chemotherapy. Her father, a Protestant minister of the Church of the God of the Union Assembly, refused to provide pain-alleviant and curative medical treatment on religious basis. In the cases [[Custody of A Minor (1978)]], [[Matter of Jensen (1981)]], [[People In Interest of D.L.E (1982)]], and [[State Dept. of Human Services v. Northern (1978)]], the Court ruled that due process and religious exemptions do not apply when the child is put to danger.
### Use

This supports Woodson, as the case shows that an immediate and present danger to the child through inaction on account of the parents is ground for removal of constitutional protections (do not word it like that exactly). Huge amounts of evidence present here, can build a strong argument that, as AIDS/HIV is a present health risk, it becomes necessary for the State to work to prevent the spread.
