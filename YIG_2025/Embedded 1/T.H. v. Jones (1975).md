## 425 F. Supp. 873 (D. Utah 1975)

https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/425/873/1513203/

### Summary

Can Planned Parenthood provide minors with family planning info without parental consent?

### Use

Useful for Woodson. Essentially, the Court argues that it is valid to provide support to minors through title XIX regulations provided that the minor voluntary requests assistance and are eligible (individuals of child-bearing aid). Limiting further (as STK is trying to do) goes against this provision.
