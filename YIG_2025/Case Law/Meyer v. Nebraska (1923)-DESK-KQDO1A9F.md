##  262 U.S. 390 (1923)
https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/262/390/

### Summary

The Court struck down a law forbidding the teaching of foreign languages to young students on account of the parental right to choose their children's education. Freedom includes the right to choose the education of your dhildren. 

### Use

Very clearly supports STK. The State cannot provide education against the interest of their parents--see the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. 

### Embedded

Most seem to be useless.
