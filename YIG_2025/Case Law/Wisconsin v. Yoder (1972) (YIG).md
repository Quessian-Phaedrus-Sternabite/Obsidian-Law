## 406 U.S. 205 (1972)

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/406/205/

### Summary

### Facts:
Though the First Amendment restricts the ability of the government to legislate religious matters, there are some times when religion comes into conflict with governmental policies (see LDS polygamy). In the case at bar, the Court was asked to discuss free exercise of religion concerning the Amish/Mennonite communities. In the communities, a desire for self-sufficiency led to the disestablishment of formal education past age 14, compliant at the time with local and federal laws. However, in the mid-20th century, law changes resulted in the minimum age to stop school being raised, resulting in a conflict.  

At the time of the case, 3 members of the community were arrested due to a violation of the state's schooling laws (compulsory until 16 as opposed to 14). A claim to the First Amendment was made, as the independence was said to be religiously mandated. With compulsory schooling, the pressure would mount until salvation is at risk; this would constitute religious persecution from the U.S. Gov. After being approved for a religious exemption by the Wisconsin Court, the issue was raised to the Supreme Court. 

Issue: 
When do government programs infringe upon First Amendment rights, can the First Amendment be used to religiously exempt people from programs, and can compulsory education overwrite religious claims?

Constitutional Text:
- 1st Amendment
	- “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof…”
- 14th Amendment
	-  “...nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law...”

Held: 
Wisconsin argued that compulsory education was a "compelling government interest," meaning the government was valid in pushing it on the community. Furthermore, high school's preparation for civil participation reinforces this compelling interest, meaning that the government had a stake in the education. If a student wished to leave the community, they also would lack the societal knowledge needed, furthering the case against the exemption. Finally, because the law is applied to everyone, there is no religious discrimination being applied, and the First Amendment is not relevant.

Meanwhile, the Amish and Mennonite communities argued that the change would violate religious beliefs, going against the first amendment. Additionally, alternative school is provided after 8th grade, which should substitute. The additional years of school wouldn't affect the children much, and aren't useful. Furthermore, not only are the communities law abiding without the additional schooling, but leaving school doesn't cause any mental or physical harm to the students. All in all, there is no reason to enforce a school minimum.

The court voted 7-0, unanimously, in favor of Yoder. The Free Exercise Clause of the 14th Amendment was utilized, as the state had no reason to compel children to attend school against religious wishes. The religion had existed for nearly 300 years, and enforcement would destroy pre-conceived ways of life. The benefits weren't substantial enough to provide "compelling government interest," and citizenship worked just fine without the requirements. There was minor dissent, as a belief existed that the children should be allowed to decide, but it was thrown out without much official consideration.

### Use

STK
	Can be used because the 14th Amendment expands 14th Amendment protections to include violations from the state.
	Issue is very similar
Woodson
	The issue is not similar. There are no religious reasons for STK to object against, and rights are not being infringed upon.
