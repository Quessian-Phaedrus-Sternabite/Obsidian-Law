### Summary

A school in New York engaged in a program handing out condoms to students without prior parental consent. Unlike the education, there was no opt-out protocol for this program.

This was held unconstitutional, as it was a health **service** and not health education. Keep in mind that this distinction was mainly due to New York law, and may not be applicable (!!!).
