### Summary

A school in New York engaged in a program handing out condoms to students without prior parental consent. Unlike the education, there was no opt-out protocol for this program.

This was held unconstitutional, as it was a health **service** and not health education. Keep in mind that this distinction was mainly due to New York law, and may not be applicable (!!!).

- A minor's normal position is is that of incompetency
- "A physician could render health services to a minor in an emergency without first consulting his or her"
- Because condom distribution is prophylaxis and not necessarily education, it does not infringe upon the rights of parents to control their children's education.
Overall, the Court argued that the condom distribution program was not valid because, while the State did have compelling interest in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, this does not allow for them acting contrary to common law. HOWEVER, this is rendered partially invalid by SCOTUS cases and law that allows for confidential consent. All things considered, the program violated constitutional rights for parents to direct the upbringing of their children. However, it does not violate free exercise of religion. 
### Use
-  _(see, Jones v. T.H._, [425 U.S. 986](https://casetext.com/case/jones-v-judicial-district-court-wr-67404-01-texcrapp-5-23-2007) [invalidating State regulations that mandated parental consent for family planning services to otherwise eligible minors]; _see also, Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Dandoy_, [810 F.2d 984](https://casetext.com/case/planned-parenthood-assn-of-utah-v-dandoy); _Jane Does 1 through 4 v. State of Utah Dept. of Health_, [776 F.2d 253](https://casetext.com/case/jane-does-v-state-of-utah-dept-of-health); _State of New York v. Heckler_, [719 F.2d 1191](https://casetext.com/case/state-of-ny-v-heckler)).
- [[Carey v. Population Servs. Intl]] - U.S. Struck down a law making it a crime to sell contraceptives to minors. "The Court held that the constitutional right of privacy in connection with decisions affecting procreation extends to minors as well as to adults."
- Parents are required by law to send their children to school, complicating the issue. 

In light of our determination that the condom availability component lacks common-law or statutory authority, and violates the petitioners' civil rights to rear their children as they see fit, the order and judgment must be reversed insofar as appealed from. Accordingly, the respondents are prohibited from dispensing condoms to unemancipated, minor students without the prior consent of their parents or guardians, or without an opt-out provision, and the petition is granted to the extent that (1) it is declared that the condom availability component of the respondents' plan constitutes a health service rather than health education and thus, in the absence of a provision requiring the prior consent of unemancipated, minor students' parents or guardians, or in the absence of an opt-out provision, lacks common-law or statutory authority, and (2) it is declared that the respondents' plan to dispense condoms to unemancipated, minor children without the consent of their parents or guardians, or an opt-out provision, violates the civil rights of the parent petitioners and similarly situated parents or guardians under the substantive Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and New York Constitution, article I, § 6. In all other respects, the petition is denied.
