## 268 U.S. 510 (1925)

### Summary

An Oregon law mandated the sending of children to public schools. The Society of Sisters, an orphanage organization, opposed this and took it to Court. To quote Oyez, "the fundamental liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only."

Arguments Included:
This harms the property and business of private schools (see [[Truax v. Reich (1915)]]), and therefore violates due process.

"No question is raised concerning the power of the State reasonably to regulate all schools, to inspect, supervise and examine them, their teachers and pupils; to require that all children of proper age attend some school, that teachers shall be of good moral character and patriotic disposition, that certain studies plainly essential to good citizenship must be taught, and that nothing be taught which is manifestly inimical to the public welfare."
