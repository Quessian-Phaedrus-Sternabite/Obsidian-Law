 ## Case Number

https://casetext.com/case/curtis-v-school-committee-of-falmouth/

### Summary

A program at Falmouth High School (FHS) made condoms available to all students via condom vending machines or school nurses. The nurses were instructed to give counseling, pamphlets on AIDS/HIV and other STDS, and maintain privacy. The program additionally took an abstinence-only approach.

Issue:
Mashpee residents attended FHS, and were very against the program due to not offering an opt-out or notifying parents when their children requested condoms. The Mashpee School Committee (MSC) voted 4-1 against, but, as the Falmouth School Committee's (FSC) contract laid out, this vote was not binding, and the program was implemented.

The plaintiffs argued that there was no compelling State interest in maintaining the condom availability program. Furthermore, they alleged that it was "coercion." 

The judge concluded that the program did not place a coercive burden on the parents' rights, and furthermore, called the program "voluntary and in no way intrudes into the realm of constitutionally protected rights." 

### Use

Constitutional concerns DO NOT APPLY. Wasn't ruled on due to not bringing them up in a lower court first.
