## 855 S.W.2d 573 (1993)

https://law.justia.com/cases/tennessee/supreme-court/1993/855-s-w-2d-573-2.html

### Summary

Grandparents Bill and Sue Hawk were denied visitation of their grandchildren due to a clash in personalities. The Grandparent visitation act, which prohibits such denial of visitation, was deemed unconstitutional.

Families are "sacred," and outside of the realm of the state. Furthermore, it is not for the government to decide things such as education, visitation in the cases where the parents are not unfit to raise children, or members of a family.

### Use

This case also argues that parents have ultimate say in the upbringing of their children, overruling that of even extended family. 
"In light of this right to privacy, we believe that when no substantial harm threatens a child's welfare, the state lacks a sufficiently compelling justification for the infringement on the fundamental right of parents to raise their children as they see fit. Thus, we find the statute to be unconstitutional under Article I, Section 8 of the Tennessee Constitution, as applied to this married couple, whose fitness as parents is unchallenged."

This is heavily in favor of STK. Giving children access to condoms against the parent's wishes goes against the definition of a family. In the case of familial matters, it is up to the parents to have the final word. See also [[Davis v. Davis (1992)]], which establishes a right to familial privacy. The court can only interfere when the child is actively being harmed. \*580
	Note: This can be used to argue against the claim. The children are not being harmed. VERY weak defense, but interesting. 
See also [[Stanley v. Illinois (1972)]], which further supports State intervention only when the child is actively being harmed.
