## 217 U.S. 349 (1910)

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/217/349/

### Summary

A U.S. official in the Philippines falsified a document. They fined him an obscene account, and sentenced him to 15 years in prison, with heavy chains and hard labor. He appealed on grounds of [[Important Quirbs#^ce25e2|cruel and unusual punishment]], and succeeded. 

### Use

* Heavily pro-carter - Such an extreme punishment for a minor crime is "impermissible."
* State - Differs, as in this case, the man was falsely tried as an official when the claimed department did not exist. As such, punishment was higher. In this case, Carter has been tried accordingly.
