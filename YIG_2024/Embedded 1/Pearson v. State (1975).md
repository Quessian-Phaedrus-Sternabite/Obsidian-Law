## 571 S.W.2d 225 (1975)

https://law.justia.com/cases/tennessee/supreme-court/1975/521-s-w-2d-225-2.html

### Summary

Used in [[State v. Harris (1992)]] to establish background for reach of the [[Important Quirbs#^ce25e2|Eighth]].
A man who committed armed robbery 4 times protested being labelled a "habitual criminal."
The habitual criminal act **was not** cruel and unusual. (See [[Frazier v. State]], [[Hobby v. State]])
"To reduce petitioner's principal complaint to simple terms, he insists that his first conviction as an habitual criminal operates to obliterate the three felony convictions upon which the present conviction is based; and, therefore, the conviction of August 2, 1973, instead of being his fifth conviction, becomes his first. In other words, he says he started all over again and is entitled to commit two more felonies before he may be convicted again as an habitual criminal." - Nuh-uh
### Use

Carter - Carter isn't a habitual criminal, nor did he commit armed robbery. The two have nothing in common.
State - If one is duly punished for committing a crime, it is not cruel nor unusual.
