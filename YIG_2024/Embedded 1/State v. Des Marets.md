## 92 N.J. 62, 455 A.2d 1074 (N.J. 1983)

https://casetext.com/case/state-v-des-marets

### Summary

A child was sentenced by the Graves act to 3 years. This had to be adjusted to comply with youth correctional facilities, and the court ruled that it did not constitute as [[Important Quirbs#^ce25e2|Cruel and Unusual Punishment]].

### Use

State
	The state must deliver punishment in accordance with the laws. In this case, the punishment was not cruel or unusual in the sense that it corresponds to a crime of similar offense. 
Carter
	In this case, the punishment was upheld, as the court did not want to overrule the Graves Act. As the case at bar does not concern itself with a similar impacting act, and as the defendant is an adult, the two are nothing alike nor comparable.
