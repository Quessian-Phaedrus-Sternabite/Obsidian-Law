## 378 U. S. 500

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/378/500/
 
### Summary
Appellants are native born citizens of the US who are ranking officials of the communist party of the United States. After hearings under state Department regulations, appellants' passports were revoked under ยง 6 of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, which provides that, when a Communist organization is registered, or under final order to register, it shall be unlawful for any member with knowledge or notice thereof to apply for or use a passport. Appellants filed suit asking that ยง 6 be declared unconstitutional as a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and that the Secretary of State be ordered to issue passports to them.
### Verdict 
The supreme court held that section 6 was unconstitutional on its face, due to how broad and indiscriminate it is in transgressing the liberty guaranteed in the fifth amendment. (Vagueness doctrine) 

### Use
#### Carter
A law can be defined as unconstitutional due to vagueness either treading on due process or harming another amendment, and how it can be so vague as to punish people even if they're unaware.
Laws cannot be so broad as to infringe upon rights without limitations.
The drug-free school--zone act consists of a very similar instance, in which one can have a crime elevated without forewarning.
