## 439 U.S. 379

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/439/379/

### Summary

Section 5(a) of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act requires every person who performs an abortion to make a determination, "based on his experience, judgment or professional competence," that the fetus is not viable. If such person determines that the fetus "is viable," or "if there is sufficient reason to believe that the fetus may be viable," then he must exercise the same care to preserve the fetus' life and health as would be required in the case of a fetus intended to be born alive, and must use the abortion technique providing the best opportunity for the fetus to be aborted alive, so long as a different technique is not necessary to preserve the mother's life or health. The Act, in § 5(d), also imposes a penal sanction for a violation of § 5(a). Appellees brought suit claiming, _inter alia,_ that § 5(a) is unconstitutionally vague.

### Verdict
A three Judge district court upheld their claim, and the supreme court did as well: the viability requirement of  5(a) is void for vagueness, due to the subjective language used and the conclusions one must draw without the law.

### Use

### Carter
Vagueness doctrine. Good argument for Carter, as one could argue that the language which allowed his sentencing is unconstitutionally vague, much like this case.
