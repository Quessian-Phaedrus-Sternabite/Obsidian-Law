## 357 U. S. 116

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/357/116/

### Summary
At a time when an Act of Congress required a passport for foreign travel by citizens if a state of national emergency had been declared by the President, and when the Proclamation necessary to make the Act effective had been made, the Secretary of State denied passports to petitioners because of their alleged Communistic beliefs and associations and their refusal to file affidavits concerning present or past membership in the Communist Party.
### Verdict
The Secretary was not authorized to deny the passports for these reasons under the Act of July 3, 1926, 22 U.S.C. § 211a, or § 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. § 1185. Pp. [357 U. S. 117](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/357/116/#117)-130. The right to travel is a part of the "liberty" of which a citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the fifth amendment; the broad power of the Secretary under 22 U.S.C. § 211a to issue passports, which has long been considered "discretionary," has been construed generally to authorize the refusal of a passport only when the applicant (1) is not a citizen or a person owing allegiance to the United States, or (2) was engaging in criminal or unlawful conduct. Also, no question concerning the exercise of war power is involved in this case.

### Use

### Carter
Kinda unrelated to the case, but maybe something about the fifth amendment can be construed here.
