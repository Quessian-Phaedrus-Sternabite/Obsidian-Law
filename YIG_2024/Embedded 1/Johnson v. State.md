## 202 So. 2d at 854 (1967)

https://casetext.com/case/johnson-v-state-2710
### Summary

A man was found chilling on a bench at 4:30 in the morning. He could not account for his whereabouts, and lacked money to ride the bus home; the officers arrested him for vagrancy. The appellant then appealed the punishment of 1 year probation, 

### Use

* State - The law isn't really that vague. It states very clearly that it is to prohibit those wandering around at late times of night without purpose, and the appellant was in direct violation. Also, unlike [[Headley v. Selkowitz]], this clearly mentions parameters for whereabout description. 
* Carter - There lacks parallel, as the unordinary hours are clearly defined and **understandable** as opposed to the case at hand.
### Embedded
