## 266 U.S. 497

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/266/497/

### Summary
Concerns [[Important Quirbs#^f29fc4|due process]]
Arguing over a law prohibiting meat falsely classified as kosher, selling kosher and non-kosher meat in the same place without labels, or fails to differentiate.
Claimed that "kosher" and "orthodox Hebrew requirements" were too [[Important Quirbs#^802bce|vague]].
	Due to difficulties in determining what was and wasn't kosher, the appellants sold all meat as non-kosher.
The laws were upheld, as it was not vague enough
### Use
* For State
	* The law was upheld due to clearly stating requirements, which had preexisting definitions.
	* 1000 feet is very clear.
	* Mentions that it is necessary to estimate at times, which is what Carter was arguing against.
* For Carter
	* Uhhhhhhhhhhh
