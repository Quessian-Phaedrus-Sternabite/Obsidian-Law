### Summary

[[Important Quirbs#^f29fc4|Due process]] mandates that laws be clear and understandable by average citizens.
Three companies (Frink Dairy Co.) were accused of violating antitrust acts. To this, they responded by claiming they were perfectly compliant, and in fact, the acts were unconstitutional (too [[Important Quirbs#^802bce|vague]]).
