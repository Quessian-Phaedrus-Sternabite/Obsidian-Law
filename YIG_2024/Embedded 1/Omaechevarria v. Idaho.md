## 246 U.S. 343

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/246/343/

### Summary

If you allow sheep to graze on a range previously used by cattle (rookie mistake), it is a misdemeanor. 
Ruled that:
* Public property is the domain of the state
* This law was not an unusual exercise of power.
* Does not discriminate
* Despite being [[Important Quirbs#^802bce|vague]], the law obeys [[Important Quirbs|due process]].
* 

### Use

* TBH, very week for both. The only possible thing could be vagueness, as well as 
* "It was found that conflicts between cattle rangers and sheep herders on the public domain could be reconciled only by segregation."
