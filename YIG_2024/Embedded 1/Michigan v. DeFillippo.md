## 443 U. S. 31

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/443/31/

### Summary

Officers arrested a man receiving sexual favors from a woman. The Court then decided that the ordinance prohibiting such behavior was unconstitutional on account of vagueness. However, it was *held* that the officer had probable cause due to not realizing the ordinance would be rendered invalid.

### Use

Very tenuously supports State, as it mentions a law being [[Important Quirbs#^802bce|vague and overbroad.]]
