## 413 U.S. 601

https://casetext.com/case/broadrick-v-oklahoma-8212-1639#p612
### Summary

The appellants were state employees charged by the Oklahoma state personnel board for actively engaging in partisan political activities (including the solicitation of money) among their coworkers for the benefit of their superior, in alleged violation of ยง 818 of the state merit system Act. The appellants brought the suit to court under the grounds that two of the paragraphs of the act are invalid because of overbreadth and vagueness. One paragraph provides that no classified service employee "shall directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, or in any manner be concerned in soliciting or receiving any assessment . . . or contribution for any political organization, candidacy or other political purpose." The other provides that no such employee shall belong to "any national, state or local committee of a political party" or be an officer or member of a committee or a partisan political club, or a candidate for any paid public office, or take part in the management or affairs of any political party or campaign"


## Verdict
The court held that section 818 of the Oklahoma statute was not unconstitutional on its face, as the statute gives more than adequate warning and explanation.
