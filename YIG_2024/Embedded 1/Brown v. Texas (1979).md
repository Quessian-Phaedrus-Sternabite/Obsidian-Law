## 443 U.S. 47

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/443/47/

### Summary
Two police officers, while cruising near noon in a patrol car, observed appellant and another man walking away from one another in an alley in an area with a high incidence of drug traffic. They stopped and asked appellant to identify himself and explain what he was doing. One officer testified that he stopped appellant because the situation "looked suspicious, and we had never seen that subject in that area before." The officers did not claim to suspect appellant of any specific misconduct, nor did they have any reason to believe that he was armed. When appellant refused to identify himself, he was arrested for violation of a Texas statute which makes it a criminal act for a person to refuse to give his name and address to an officer "who has lawfully stopped him and requested the information." Appellant's motion to set aside an information charging him with violation of the statute on the ground that the statute violated the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments was denied, and he was convicted and fined.

#### Verdict
The application of the Texas statute to detain appellant and require him to identify himself and require him to identify himself violated the Fourth amendment, as the officers lacked any reasonable suspicion to believe that the appellant was engaged or had engaged in criminal conduct. Clashes with the fourth amendment's requirement that seizure must be reasonable.
### Use

##### Carter
This supports Carter by speaking on unreasonable seizure and suspicion, giving us possible basis in the fourth amendment.
### State
Does not apply, as it concerns search and seizure, not vagueness.
