### Summary

Petitioners, peaceful civil rights demonstrators, were arrested and convicted for disorderly conduct when they failed to disperse on orders of the Chicago police, who anticipated civil disorder because of the bystanders' unruly conduct. The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed.
### Verdict
Petitioners were denied due process, since there was no evidentiary support for their convictions , the convictions were for demonstrating, not for refusing to obey police orders. The trial judge's charge allowed the jury to convict for acts protected by the First amendment.
