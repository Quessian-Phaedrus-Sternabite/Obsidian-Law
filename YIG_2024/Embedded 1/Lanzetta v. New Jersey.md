## 306 U.S. 451 (1939)

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/306/451/

### Summary

Appellants were convicted due to violating gang acts. However, the law is too vague, as it states "two or more people constituting a gang," failing to provide a definition for a gang.   

### Use

"No one may be required, at peril of life, liberty, or property, to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes." 

### Embedded

[[Connally v. General Construction (1926)]]
[[Lovell v. City of Griffin]]
