## 234 U.S. 634

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/234/634/

### Summary
People must not sell tobacco under minimum price ([[International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky (1914)]] all over again)
Due to Harvester, the sellers may pool their crops together to sell them higher, however, they must do so through an agent.
Due to [[Important Quirbs#^802bce|vague]] terms, ruled invalid, as he had to try and decide his price.
### Use
* Pretty classic vagueness doctrine fare. Could support Carter, as it mentions 
	"state penal statute which prescribes no standard of conduct that it is possible to know violates the fundamental principles of justice embodied in the conception of due process of law.
* Could also support state, as the law is very specific in saying "1000 feet"
### Embedded Case Law
[[International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky (1914)]]
