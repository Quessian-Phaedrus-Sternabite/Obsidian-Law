## 584 S.W.2d 765

https://law.justia.com/cases/tennessee/supreme-court/1979/584-s-w-2d-765-2.html

### Summary
The defendant, Ralph Cozzolino, pled guilty to the first degree murder of Clarence Hamler, an officer of the Chattanooga Police Department. A proceeding was then held under the provisions of TCA ยง 39-2404 to determine the punishment to be imposed. Under this statute, a trial of first degree murder is a bifurcated proceeding, with the jury first determining the defendant's guilt or innocence of the charge, or, as happened here, with the defendant first admitting his guilt. If it is found that the defendant is guilty of first degree murder, a second proceeding is held before the same jury to determine the sentence either life imprisonment or death to be imposed. The defendant has raised several assignments of error, only two of which we need reach. The first of these is his contention that the death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The defendant has raised another claim that we consider dispositive of the case. He contends that it was error for the trial judge to permit the State to introduce, in its case in chief, evidence that the defendant committed crimes subsequent to the murder, in that this evidence was not relevant to the proof of the presence or absence of any statutory aggravating circumstance or mitigating factor, the only issues properly before the jury.

### Verdict
The court reverses, and remands for a new sentencing proceeding. While the court doesn't find anything against cruel and unusual punishment (more about that in uses) they do find that introducing prior crimes with no weight upon the case is a crucial error, and as such, a retrial is required.

### Use

### State
Court finds that "In that case, the question was not raised as to whether the death penalty could stand in the face of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment contained in the state constitution. Without detailing the precise scope of the protection afforded by that clause, we hold that it places no greater restriction on the punishments that may be imposed by this state than does the federal constitution." The state can hold some role in determining what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment if not laid out by federal court. (at least, that's what I gleam of this.)
### Carter
What's used for state also may hold as a potential argument for vagueness doctrine.
