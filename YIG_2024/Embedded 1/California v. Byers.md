## 402 U. S. 424

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/402/424/

### Summary
Respondent demurred to a count of an indictment charging him with violating Cal.Vehicle Code ยง 20002(a)(1) (Supp. 1971) by failing to stop and furnish his name and address after involvement in an automobile accident, resulting in damage to property, on the ground that compliance would have violated his privilege against self-incrimination. His demurrer was sustained by the California Supreme Court, which held that compliance confronted respondent with "substantial hazards of self-incrimination," but upheld the statute by inserting a use restriction on the information disclosed. That court concluded that it would be unfair to punish respondent, since he could not reasonably have anticipated the use restriction.
### Verdict
Case was vacated and remanded, as the supreme court said that the possibility of incrimination is not substantial doesn't infringe the privilege against self-incrimination. Also, there's apparently "no constitutional right to flee the scene of an accident to avoid any possible legal involvement." (whatever that means.)

### Use

### State
Gives an argument against anything relating to self incrimination and the possibility of criminal involvement. Primary takeaway, however, is that it's still more than fair to punish the respondent (Carter, in this case) even if he's unaware of the use restriction. You can be punished even if not aware.
