### Summary

A man pleaded guilty to multiple, *multiple* counts of tomfoolery. He then was punished for being a habitual offender, which he claimed he was not aware of as a policy.
Not[[Important Quirbs#^ce25e2| cruel and unusual punishment]], as the habitual criminal act elevates repeat offenders.

### Use
