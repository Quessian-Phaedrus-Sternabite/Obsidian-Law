[[California v. Byers]] if you aren't informed about possible consequences of self-incrimination, it still is valid. Being vague in providing information is not overtly vague. 

See [[Hobby v. State]] - C& E

"No one may be required, at peril of life, liberty, or property, to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes." - [[Lanzetta v. New Jersey]], [[Lewis v. City of New Orleans]]

[[Minnesota ex rel. Pearson v. Probate Court]]

A law is not vague if it provides a narrow range of power with clearly defined limits. - [[Parker v. Levy]]
