### Summary

A man transported explosives through a tunnel, and claimed the statute prohibiting transporting explosives through a tunnel was "too [[Important Quirbs#^802bce |vague]]."
The court disagreed (it wasn't).
### Use

* State
	* Much like in Carter's case, the statute was very clear as to what was prohibited, and left nothing to be decided.
* Carter
	* Irrelevant. In this case, the appeal was denied due to the law clearly stating "tunnels." A tunnel is very obvious and clearly defined--1000 feet is not.
