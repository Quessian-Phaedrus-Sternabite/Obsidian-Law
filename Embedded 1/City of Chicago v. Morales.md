## 527 U.S. 41 (1999)

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/527/41/

### Summary

Chicago's Gang Congregation Ordinance prohibits "criminal street gang members" from loitering in public places. Under the ordinance, if a police officer observes a person whom he reasonably believes to be a gang member loitering in a public place with one or more persons, he shall order them to disperse. Anyone who does not promptly obey such an order has violated the ordinance. The police department's General Order 92-4 purports to limit officers' enforcement discretion by confining arrest authority to designated officers, establishing detailed criteria for defining street gangs and membership therein, and providing for designated, but publicly undisclosed, enforcement areas.
### Verdict
Inherently unconstitutional due to being impermissibly vague on its face and an arbitrary restriction on personal liberties; this judgement is upheld by the supreme court.

### Use

##### Carter
Works for both vagueness doctrine and loitering; the fact that this is "impermissibly vague" offers a great argument in favor of Carter and the unconstitutionality of his arrest.
