## Â 394 U. S. 721

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/394/721/

### Summary

In connection with a rape investigation the Meridian, Mississippi, police, without warrants, brought numerous Negro youths to the police station for questioning and fingerprinting. Petitioner was thus questioned and fingerprinted, and released. Thereafter, concededly without a warrant or probable cause for arrest, the police drove petitioner to Jackson and confined him in jail overnight. After he was questioned and signed a statement, he was returned to Meridian and jailed. While so confined, he was again fingerprinted and these prints were sent to the FBI for comparison with latent prints found in the victim's home. The fingerprint evidence was admitted at petitioner's trial for rape, over objection that it was the product of unlawful detention, and he was convicted. The Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the conviction.

## Verdict 
The supreme court reverses the verdict. This is an issue of primarily the fourth amendment, as "Fingerprint evidence is no exception to the rule that all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is inadmissible in a state court.", "The Fourth Amendment applies to involuntary detention occurring at the investigatory stage as well as at the accusatory stage.", and "Detentions for the sole purpose of obtaining fingerprints are subject to the constraints of the Fourth Amendment.". In essence, although they were able to get a confession, it doesn't hold in court, as the petitioner was persecuted unlawfully due to violation of his fourth amendment rights.

Unlawful search and seizure. Gleam from that what you will; although it's a bit difficult to gain direct connections.
