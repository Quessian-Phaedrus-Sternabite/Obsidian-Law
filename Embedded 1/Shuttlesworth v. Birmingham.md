## 382 U.S. 87 (1965)

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/382/87/

### Summary

A group of men stood on a sidewalk when a policeman came walking by and demanded they clear the way. All but one obliged, and the petitioner elected to ask the officer why he needed to move. The officer arrested the petitioner, who was tried and sentenced **without a jury.** (violation of [[Important Quirbs#^f29fc4 |due process]]. 
Held:
	A conviction can be overturned if the base ordinance is unconstitutional

### Use

* Carter - Not necessarily [[Important Quirbs#^802bce|vagueness]], as it was condemmed for being too broad. However, some parallels, as the broadness was unconstitutional.
* State - These two are nothing alike. The law is not condemned for being vague, it is condemned for giving too much power with loose definitions.
