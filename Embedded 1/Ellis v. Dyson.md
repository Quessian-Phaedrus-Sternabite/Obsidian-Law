### Summary
Petitioners Tom E. Ellis and Robert D. Love, while in an automobile, were arrested in Dallas at 2 a.m. on January 18, 1972, and were charged with violating the city's loitering ordinance. That ordinance, § 31-60 of the 1960 Revised Code of Civil and Criminal Ordinances of the City of Dallas, Texas, as amended by Ordinance No. 12991, adopted July 20, 1970, provides: "It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter, as hereinafter defined, in, on or about any place, public or private, when such loitering is accompanied by activity or is under circumstances that afford probable cause for alarm or concern for the safety and wellbeing of persons or for the security of property, in the surrounding area."
The term "loiter" is defined to "include the following activities: the walking about aimlessly without apparent purpose; lingering; hanging around; lagging behind; the idle spending of time; delaying; sauntering and moving slowly about, where such conduct is not due to physical defects or conditions. "A violation of the ordinance is classified as a misdemeanor, and is punishable by a fine of not more than $200. Before their trial in the Dallas Municipal Court  petitioners sought a writ of prohibition from the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to preclude their prosecution on the ground that the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face. App. 29. The petitioners contended, in particular, that § 31-60 is vague and overbroad, that it "permits arrest on the basis of alarm or concern only," and that it allows the offense to be defined "upon the moment-by-moment opinions and suspicions of a police officer on patrol." App. 31. The Court of Criminal Appeals, however, denied the application without opinion on February 21, 1972. The following day, the Municipal Court proceeded to try the case. After overruling petitioners' motion to dismiss the charges on the grounds of the ordinance's unconstitutionality, the court accepted their pleas of  and fined each petitioner $10 plus $2.50 costs.
After being convicted and fined by the Municipal Court, on pleas of _nolo contendere,_ for violating the Dallas loitering ordinance, petitioners, rather than seeking a trial _de novo_ in County Court, and thus subjecting themselves to the possibility of a larger fine, brought action in Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance and seeking declaratory and other relief. The District Court dismissed the action, holding that federal declaratory and injunctive relief against future state criminal prosecutions was not available absent allegations of bad faith prosecution, harassment, or other unusual circumstances presenting a likelihood of irreparable injury to petitioners if the ordinance were enforced, a result felt to be mandated by the decision in _Becker v. Thompson,_ 459 F.2d 919 (CA5), wherein it was held that the principles of _Younger v. Harris,_ [401 U. S. 37](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/401/37/), applied not only where a state criminal prosecution was actually pending, but also where a prosecution was merely threatened. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

### Verdict
Since the _Becker_ decision was subsequently reversed in _Steffel v. Thompson,_ [415 U. S. 452](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/415/452/), wherein it was held that federal declaratory relief is not precluded when a state prosecution based upon an assertedly unconstitutional state statute has been threatened, but is not pending, even if a showing of bad faith enforcement or other special circumstances has not been made, the Court of Appeals' judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for reconsideration in light of _Steffel_ as to whether there is a genuine threat of prosecution and as to the relationship between the past prosecution and the alleged threat of future prosecutions. Essentially, vagueness doctrine and bad faith.

Vagueness doctrine; loitering. Good argument for bad faith as well, maybe.
