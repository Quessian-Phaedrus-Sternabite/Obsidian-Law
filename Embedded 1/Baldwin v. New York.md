## Â 399 U.S. 66

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/399/66/

### Summary

One must have a jury if tried for a crime with punishment more than six months.

### Use

If mentioned, it simply doesn't apply. This deals with right to a jury, not [[Important Quirbs#^802bce|vagueness]].

### Embedded

[[Duncan v. Louisiana]]
More, though since case is irrelevant, I won't include them yet.
