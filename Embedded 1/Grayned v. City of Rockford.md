## 408 U.S. 104

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/408/104/

### Summary

A law can be clear even if it's words are [[Important Quirbs#^802bce|vague]] if the law as a whole is clear.
It is constitutional to prohibit excessive noise during sessions of schools. The decision is *not vague*, as the law is very clearly against school public noise, and it can be reasonably inferred.
Additionally, the law does not infringe 1st Amendment Rights, as it is merely concerned with schools (perhaps?)
