## 234 U.S. 216 

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/234/216/

### Summary

Antitrust law was made in Kentucky that said people couldn't sell things for prices below or above their "real value."

Ruled invalid due to not being able to easily determine real price ([[Important Quirbs#^802bce |Vagueness Doctrine]])

### Use
* Carter:
	* Again corresponds to vagueness. This supports [[Connally v. General Construction (1926)]], which it is embedded in.
* State:
	* It mentions "know in advance and comply with." When Carter sold crack to those kids, there is no reason he shouldn't have known the law.
### Embedded Case Law
[[Nash v. United States (!)]] (1)
