### Summary

An ordinance of appellant village require a business to obtain a license if it sells any items that are designed or marketed to assist with the use of taking illegal cannabis and drugs. It defines the items Â (such as "roach clips," which are used to smoke cannabis, "pipes," and "paraphernalia") that require a license. Appellee, who sold such merchandise, took the appellant to court once notified of the ordinance on the grounds that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, requesting injunctive and declaratory relief and damages. The District court heard the case.
### Verdict
The verdict was held, as the ordinance is not facially overbroad or vague but is reasonably clear in its application to appellee.
### Use
#### State 
Offers insight into the way that vagueness doctrine plays with drug use.
When a statute prohibits drugs, it is far reaching in scope to affect all drugs, even non-specified ones.
