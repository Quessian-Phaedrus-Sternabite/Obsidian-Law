## 384 Mass. 495, 427 N.E.2d 17

https://law.justia.com/cases/massachusetts/supreme-court/1981/384-mass-495-2.html

### Summary

In 1975 the petitioner was convicted of assault with intent to murder, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon,  and unlawful possession of a machine gun. He appealed under G.L.c. 278, §§ 33A-33G. We took the defendant's appeal for direct review and affirmed his convictions. Commonwealth v. Cepulonis, 374 Mass. 487 (1978). Cepulonis filed a petition for a writ of error and a single justice reserved and reported the case to the full court on the joint motion of the petitioner and the Commonwealth. The petitioner now challenges his sentence of forty to fifty years on the possession of the machine gun charge on the ground that such a sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.[1] He claims, further, that possession of a machine gun is a lesser included offense of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and that, therefore, his conviction on both charges is a violation of the prohibition against double jeopardy. Finally, the petitioner appeals all three convictions on the ground that he was denied effective assistance of counsel both at sentencing and on his prior direct appeal.

### Verdict
Not cruel and unusual punishment, dumbass. You did the crime, you pay the proper amount of time; and you have absolutely no protection against double jeopardy in this case. Here that is in legalese: "We conclude that a sentence of forty to fifty years for a violation of G.L.c. 269, § 10(c), does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Further, we hold that the petitioner was neither subjected to double jeopardy nor was he denied effective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments. The facts are set out in our earlier opinion. Commonwealth v. Cepulonis, 374 Mass. 487 (1978). We limit our discussion here to the validity of the sentence imposed for the possession of the machine gun and the questions of double jeopardy and effective assistance of counsel."
### Use

### State
Provides a very solid argument against double jeopardy in Carter's case, and also cruel and unusual punishment, if perhaps to a lesser extent.
