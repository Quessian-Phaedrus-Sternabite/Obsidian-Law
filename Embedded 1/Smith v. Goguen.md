### Summary

A man *sewed an American Flag on his butt and was sued.* 
The law saying the flag can't be treated "contemptuously" was ruled too [[Important Quirbs#^802bce|vague]].

### Use

Very goofy vagueness doctrine for Carter.
Also; This relates in no way to the case.

### Embedded

[[Picard v. Connor]]
[[Grayned v. City of Rockford]]
