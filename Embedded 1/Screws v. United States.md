 ### Summary

Officers arrested and beat an African-American citizen to death. The officers appealed, saying that the act prohibiting "willfully depriving a person of any right secured to him by the [[Important Quirbs#^f29fc4|due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment]]" was too [[Important Quirbs#^802bce|vague]] to understand. This was struck down, as it is very clear. 

### Use

* Carter - This case, simply put, is non-applicable. The law was clear and easy to understand, provided one has read the Fourteenth Amendment, which is freely available. **It does not require on-the-spot decisions** (see [[International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky]])
* State -  These two cases are extremely similar. In both Screws and the case at bar, the law provides comprehensible definitions. Both laws/acts provide a clear, easy to understand definition. Both are *not vague*.
